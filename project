        <h1>Slavery in Canada</h1>
        <p><strong>Researched and compiled by Albert Biliavtsev</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>While Canada is often celebrated as a sanctuary for freedom seekers via the Underground Railroad, its own history with slavery is complex and often overlooked. Enslavement of Indigenous and African peoples existed for over two centuries under both French and British rule. This website explores the presence and impact of slavery in Canada, highlighting key events, figures, and documents.</p>

        <h2>Origins of Slavery in Canada</h2>
        <p>Slavery in Canada dates back to the early 1600s, when both Indigenous and African people were enslaved by European colonists. The first recorded African slave in Canada was Olivier Le Jeune, brought to New France in 1628. Indigenous slavery, often overlooked, was just as prevalent, with the French using Indigenous captives as forced labor.</p>
        <p>By the late 18th century, thousands of Black and Indigenous people were enslaved across the colonies. British Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution brought enslaved people with them, increasing the number of enslaved Black individuals in Canada.</p>

        <h2>Key Events and Legislation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1689-1709: French Colonial Slave Codes:</strong> These laws classified enslaved people as property, granting full control to their owners.</li>
            <li><strong>1793 Act to Limit Slavery:</strong> One of the first legal restrictions on slavery in the British Empire, preventing further importation and setting a path for gradual abolition.</li>
            <li><strong>1807 British Slave Trade Act:</strong> Banned the transatlantic slave trade but did not free enslaved people already in the colonies.</li>
            <li><strong>1833 Slavery Abolition Act:</strong> Officially abolished slavery across the British Empire, including Canada.</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Railroad (1800s):</strong> Thousands of African Americans fled to Canada seeking freedom, aided by figures like Harriet Tubman.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Notable Figures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Marie-Joseph Angélique:</strong> An enslaved Black woman in Montreal who was accused of arson and executed in 1734.</li>
            <li><strong>Sophia Pooley:</strong> Enslaved by Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, she later gained her freedom and provided key firsthand accounts of Canadian slavery.</li>
            <li><strong>Josiah Henson:</strong> A former slave who settled in Canada and established a refuge for freed slaves.</li>

        <h2>Conditions of Enslavement</h2>
        <p>Enslaved people in Canada were often forced into domestic service, agriculture, and trade work. While some were treated as status symbols by their owners, others were subjected to extreme physical abuse and harsh labor.</p>
        
        <h2>Resistance and Rebellion</h2>
        <p>Many enslaved people resisted through escape, rebellion, and legal action. Some, like Marie-Joseph Angélique, were accused of acts of resistance, while others successfully fled via the Underground Railroad.</p>
        
        <h2>End of Slavery and Its Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Even after slavery was abolished in 1834, discrimination persisted. Black Canadians were often denied land, employment, and equal rights. Some communities, like Africville in Nova Scotia, suffered systemic racism and displacement.</p>
        
        <h2>Modern Recognition</h2>
        <p>Today, Canada acknowledges its history through Emancipation Day (August 1st) and the preservation of historic sites related to slavery and the Underground Railroad.</p>
